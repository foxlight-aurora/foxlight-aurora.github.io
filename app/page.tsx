const TIPS = [
  ["Look north", "In Oulu the aurora usually starts as a pale arc low on the northern horizon."],
  ["Give it 20 minutes", "Eyes need time to adapt. Avoid your phone screen — or set it to red/night mode."],
  ["Use your camera", "Phones in night mode see faint aurora as green before your eyes do."],
  ["Peak hours", "Activity over Finland usually peaks between 22:00 and 02:00, but can flare up any time it's dark."],
  ["Dress for −20 °C", "Waiting is part of it. Layers, a hat, and something warm to drink."],

const FAQ = [
  [
    "Can you see the northern lights in Oulu?",
    "Yes. Oulu is at 65°N, near the edge of the auroral oval, so auroras show on many clear, dark nights between late August and mid-April. A Kp index of about 2 is often enough at dark spots outside the city; from around Kp 4 they can be seen from the city centre.",
  ],
  [
    "When is the best time to see the aurora in Oulu?",
    "The season runs from late August to mid-April; in summer the nights are too light. Activity over Finland usually peaks between 22:00 and 02:00, but auroras can appear whenever it is dark and clear. The forecast above shows the best window for the next three nights.",
  ],
  [
    "Where are the best places to see the northern lights near Oulu?",
    "Somewhere dark with an open view to the north. Nallikari beach and the northern tip of Hietasaari work on good nights; for fainter displays go further out, to Virpiniemi, Sanginjoki or Hailuoto (Marjaniemi). The list above ranks them for tonight.",
  ],
  [
    "How does this forecast work?",
    "It combines NOAA's Kp forecast and real-time solar wind with FMI's local auroral activity (R-index), the FMI cloud forecast and the position of the sun into a chance for each viewing spot, refreshed several times an hour. It is a forecast, not a promise.",
